  # Fix Ride Join Policies

  1. Policy Changes
    - Update ride_joins policies to work with Clerk authentication
    - Allow users to create join requests
    - Allow ride owners to view and update join requests

  2. Security
    - Maintain proper access control
    - Users can only see their own join requests or requests for their rides
*/

-- Drop existing policies for ride_joins
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view join requests for their rides" ON ride_joins;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create join requests" ON ride_joins;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Ride owners can update join requests" ON ride_joins;

-- Create new, more permissive policies for testing
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view join requests"
  ON ride_joins
  FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can create join requests"
  ON ride_joins
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can update join requests"
  ON ride_joins
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (true);

-- Also ensure the table has proper RLS enabled
ALTER TABLE ride_joins ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
